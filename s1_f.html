    <p id="art-desc"> Cloudy was a character that I have designed and used in a lot of my <br>
        creative works this semester. I wanted to express how unpredictable <br>
        human feelings can beâ€“just like the weather. <br>
        I added a few of my own favorite photos accommpanied with different <br>
        phrases that describe thoughts and emotions that <br>
        I think of depending on the weather.
