    <p id="art-desc"> For this assignment, we experimented with CSS tools to recreate <br>
        a still life photo on code pen. <br>
        I had a lot of fun playing around with the CSS animations and played <br>
        with the words or meanings of different objects <br>
        to make the still life more interactive and <br>
        ...<br>
        not as still.
