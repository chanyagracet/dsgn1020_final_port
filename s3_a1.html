       "Hello world" is a phrase familiar to computer scientists. <br>
       As a result of a successful programming tutorial, students <br>
       are often taught to print into the console, terminal, or webpage the phrase <br>
       "Hello world". Since our group member are comprised with those <br>
    studying the intersection of CS and design, we wanted to incorporate <br>
this into our instruction piece by recreating a fake .java environment to mimic <br>
a coding tutorial for a peanut butter & jelly sandwich.    </p>
