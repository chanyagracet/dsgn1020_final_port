    <p id="art-desc"> According to Oxford Languages, an "emoji" (eâ€¢moâ€¢ji) is defined as <br>
        "a small digital image or icon used to express an idea, emotion, etc."
        <br>
        As you may see in the rest of my portfolio, I really like to play with emojis. <br>
        Even though they are used to convey emotions, I believe they also <br>hide our true emotions from the viewer, audience, or receiver.<br>
        Hence in this particular piece, I used emojis to represent the pixels of a <br>yellow, neon smiley face to convey how a smile can be<br> composed of many smiles and other emotions that we keep hidden as well.
