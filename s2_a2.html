    <p id="art-desc"> Lately, I have been creating a lot of playlists on Spotify. <br>
        The reason is because my friend told me that these playlists <br>
        are a way of documenting our lives at certain points in time. <br>
        Since this assignment is about creatively delivering messages to a <br>
        diverse range of audience, I utilized visuals of the playlist cover, <br>
        songs, and also the title text to convey
        what each playlist <br> is about or describing the images.
